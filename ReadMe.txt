This application, Out of Office Responder, is a work in progress and it is probably really crappy, insecure, etc etc. So, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
I wanted an application that would automatically send text messages to someone who calls or texts me when I am in a meeting or unavailable.
I wanted to make this application into a widget so it could be right on the homescreen and I may eventually do so.

In order to get this onto your phone, you are going to have to follow these steps.

1. Download project
2. Unzip and place with other Eclipse projects (in your workspace or where ever you want)
3. Open Eclipse and import it as an exisiting project
4. Run the application, pointing it to your phone which is plugged in via USB.

Doing these steps should install the application on your phone.
